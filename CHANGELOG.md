# Changelog


## HEAD

- Added `aswap` package. Atomic swap implementation is now separate from `escrow`.
- Added `migration` package. Schema versioning can be implemented by relying on
  functionality provided by this package.
- `gconf` package was reimplemented from scratch
- `x/cash` is using new `gconf` package for configuration. New genesis path is
  used. To update genesis file, replace "gconf": { "cash:xyz": "foo" }
  with "conf": { "cash": { "xyz": "foo" } }
- Tests were cleaned up and no use testify or convey packages. A new package
  `weavetest/assert` contains test helpers
- Simplify transaction message unpacking with `weave.LoadMsg`
- Initial version of governance model
- Introducing go modules instead of dep
- Removed support for go 1.10
- Added support for go 1.12
- Bumped minimum required version of go to 1.11.4+ as otherwise some commands
  fail because of go mod constraints
