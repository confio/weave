/*

Package nft provides a core of a Non-fungible token implementation (NFT).
Specialized implementations are located in submodules.

This package is a data container. Think of it as an implementation of a
document store with permission (approval) control and possibility to create
more than one index for each document. It does not provide a standalone
implementation. This is a framework for building custom NFT implementations.
